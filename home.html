      <h1>About Me</h1>   
		<ul>
	    <p>A deligent and hardworking student seeking a summer work-term placement. I enjoy working in IT and new technology. I have a good problem-solving and communication skills. Considering a career in database administration, my responsibility as a database administrator (DBA) will be the performance, integrity and security of a database. With my ten years experience in a  service-oriented company, providing solutions to financial institutions, in my previous job in the Philippines, I knew how important to have someone to make sure that the databases are up and running, performing well and configured to function appropriately. </p>
